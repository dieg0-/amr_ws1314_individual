Braitenberg Behaviors
================================

Agent Types
-------------------------
* TYPE_A: This type couples each motor or wheel with the sonar directly placed on the same size of the robot. Therefore, when the left sonar
	  detects an obstacle, the left wheel will increase its speed, making the robot move to the right, and vice versa. 
* TYPE_B: This type couples the wheels in an inverse way, the left sonar with the right wheel and vice versa. Therefore, when the left sonar
    	  detects an obstacle, the right wheel will increase its speed, making the robot move to the left (towards the obstacle), and 
          eventually crashing.
* TYPE_C: mojombo/god@be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2
